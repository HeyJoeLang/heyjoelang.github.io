        <b>Problem</b><br>Leia embarked on an ambitious project to launch our marketstore with over 40 games. These games varied in complexity and audience, requiring a nuanced approach to porting, testing, and launching to ensure they met our high-quality standards.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>My Solution</b><br>To manage this project effectively, I implemented the following strategies:

        <li align="left">Project Management: Developed a detailed project plan outlining key milestones and deadlines for each game. Utilized project management software to track progress, assign tasks, and manage resources efficiently.</li>
        <li align="left">Communication: Established clear lines of communication with our publishing partners. Held regular update meetings to discuss progress, address challenges, and ensure everyone was aligned on the project's goals and timelines.</li>
        <li align="left">Quality Assurance Collaboration: Worked closely with our QA team to develop a rigorous testing protocol for each game. This ensured any bugs were identified early and could be communicated to our publishing partners for resolution.</li>
        <li align="left">Feedback Loops: Created a structured process for sending update requests and bug reports to our publishing partners, ensuring that feedback was clear, actionable, and tracked through to resolution.</li>
        <li align="left">Launch Coordination: As games passed QA, I coordinated with the publishers to ensure a smooth launch.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>The Result</b><br>This comprehensive approach led to the successful porting, testing, and launching of all 40 games within the projected timeline.
