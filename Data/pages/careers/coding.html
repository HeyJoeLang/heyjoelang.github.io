    <b>Problem</b><br>Leia Unity SDK only supported default rendering, blocking content from working on our displays.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>My Solution</b><br>I restructured our SDK to add catches and hooks into Post Processing, URP, and HDRP renderinf pipelines.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>The Result</b><br>Leia Displays work out of the box with all rendering techniques.

    <b>Problem</b><br>Leia's Unity plugin releases were ad-hock, breaking changes were commonly thrown into release update, and bugs were not caught prior to releases.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>My Solution</b><br>I standardized our workflow: 
    <p align="left">Daily standups were introduced to review tickets and status.</p>
    <p align="left">Jira tickets were tethered to branches and Pull Requests, making context and code changes easy to navigate.</p>
    <p align="left">Pull request workflow was standardized, ensuring team collaboration.</p>
    <p align="left">CI generated test builds to verify PR's did not brak core functionality.</p>
    <p align="left">I mapped out our release process an announcement process so anyone on the team can launch an update</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>The Result</b><br>The workflow for the entire team was smoother, bugs were caught sooner, and the SDK was matured.

    I simplified our Unity plugin logic from 40 classes to 8 without breaking core functionality. This allowed us to redesign for cross compatability between Android and Windows.

    After Leia aquired Dimenco, we needed one plugin that could work across all displays on Windows and Android. I restructured our Unity plugin to handle this.
