    <b>Problem</b><br>Leia Unity SDK only supported default rendering, blocking content from working on our displays.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>My Solution</b><br>I restructured our SDK to add catches and hooks into Post Processing, URP, and HDRP renderinf pipelines.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>The Result</b><br>Leia Displays work out of the box with all rendering techniques.

    <b>Problem</b><br>Leia's Unity plugin releases were ad-hock, breaking changes were commonly thrown into release update, and bugs were not caught prior to releases.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>My Solution</b><br>I standardized our workflow:
    <li align="left"></li>Daily standups were introduced to review tickets and status.</li>
    <li align="left">Jira tickets were tethered to branches and Pull Requests, making context and code changes easy to navigate.</li>
    <li align="left"></li>Pull request workflow was standardized, ensuring team collaboration.</li>
    <li align="left">CI generated test builds to verify PR's did not brak core functionality.</li>
    <li align="left">I mapped out our release process an announcement process so anyone on the team can launch an update</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>The Result</b><br>The workflow for the entire team was smoother, bugs were caught sooner, and the SDK was matured.

    <b>Problem</b><br>As Leia grew over the years, the Unity Plugin became increasing more complicated to handle old assumptions and new.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>My Solution</b><br>I simplified our Unity plugin logic from 40 classes to 8 without breaking core functionality. Addiditional features were then prioritized and mapped for integration.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>The Result</b><br> We now had a plugin that was simple enough to reshape for future needs without the overhead of old assumptions and tech de

    <b>Problem</b><br>After Leia aquired Dimenco, we needed one plugin that could work across all displays on Windows and Android
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>My Solution</b><br>With our new simplified plugin structure, I was able to abstract out all device logic and set two streams for firmware communication.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>The Result</b><br>We now have one logic flow that worked on all supported devices, Android or Windows. Later, when we added features, no code needed to be duplicated.
